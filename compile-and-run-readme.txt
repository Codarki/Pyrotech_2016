Two options to run the demo:
1.
	- open \demo2016\exe folder and click 2016.bat
2. 
	- Download Visual Studio 2019
	- Open democodebase\demo2008\demo2008.sln
	- Compile solution
	- Run

First run will take a while. It will convert all the data from src-data to
exe/data directory.

There are many batch files in exe directory which will run specific scenes.
Inspecting the batch files will reveal how they are linked to a timeline file,
and from thereafter you can discover the datadriven nature of the whole project.
