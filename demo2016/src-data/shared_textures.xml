<!--
    Here are defined shared textures, which can be used as material parameter as well as render_to_texture input values.
    Also MRT(Multiple Render Targets) textures are defined here.
    
    Possible parameters for the resolution child tag are:
    <resolution v="1024 768"/> -> where numbers are texture dimensions
    <resolution v="screen"/> -> where screen is current screen resolution dimension
    <resolution v="backbuffer"/> -> where backbuffer is current backbuffer dimension, this is needed for MRT targets
