 - Separated scene rendering to two passes: opaques first and translucents
   second. Translucent rendering has additive blend with depth write disabled,
   so they can be drawn in any order. This means that additive translucent
   objects now draw correctly with opaques in the same scene.
   When multiple scenes are drawn at the same time, where all have opaques
   and translucents, drawing is incorrect.
 - Changed translucent rendering to alpha blend solely on alpha channel.
   (texture alpha channel * shader alpha coefficient). This fixes alpha
   blending in general. (might have to adjust texture maps)
 - Translucent objects are drawn only once and without a light, instead for
   each light. All transparent materials has to be made N count brighter.
   (N is the count of lights in the scene)
 - Added depth pre-pass. Renders opaque scene without lights and color write
   disabled, without any pixel shader. This eliminates overdraw, and speeds
   up all scenes with heavy pixel shader.
 - Optimized Cook-Torrance shader for pixels, where light is facing away.
 - Hierarchical transformations works for parented items.

29.7.2009
 - image sequence for noise is now optional. Noise post processing tries to
   load "data/images/noise.jpg" if omitted. The texture is still required.
 - Breaking change. Added "frequency" parameter to noise.
 - Prevented all paths to d3d9 resize, so window can be moved and resized.
   Will not resize rendertarget though.
 - Audio rewind on timeline rewind seems to be broken.

28.7.2009
 - TCB Rotation controller works (TCB parameters ignored for now). ie smooth
   rotations. (Euler Rotation controller plots a key for each frame, and linear
   interpolation is used, TCB Rotation controller sets keys as seen in Max)
 - Tension, Continuity and Bias parameters are read and used in engine, in
   all other than rotation keys (ie position and scale).

27.7.2009
 - Cleaned some spam from logging.
 - Normal scale re-enabled in Cook-Torrance.
 - Added emission map to Cook-Torrance shader with coefficient value.
 - Optimized Cook-Torrance shader to skip per-pixel lighting when light
   attenuation is small enough.
 - Added "general_texcoord_offset", "color_texcoord_offset" and
   "emission_texcoord_offset" parameters to Cook-Torrance shader.

26.7.2009
 - Tangent space calculation fixed for all triangles. Not sure if it's final working fix.
 - Fixed a bug where sequence added child programmatically. (audio_system)

25.7.2009
 - Plasma sequence now automatically sets "child_texture" for its effect.

24.7.2009
 - Refactored all sequences. All sequences are now composite sequences. This removes
   most of the special cases in configurations. Should not break existing timelines, but
   allows greatly simplified configurations.
 - Fixed a bug where shader default parameter values was never used, and crashed.

22.7.2009
 - Refactored all sequences to update and draw in single pass. It is now possible
   to playback same sequence multiple times at the same time.
 - Fixed bug where curves were read two times, breaking shared_textures.
 - Added shared_textures, which can be linked to draw_to_texture sequence and material
   input parameter.
 - Fixed a bug in draw_to_texture where depth was cleared.

21.7.2009
 - Engine sets world_to_view matrix automatically.
 - Added optional "additive" keys to random curves, where random keys are relative
   (gets added) to previous, rather than being absolute keys. Use of additive requires
   use of "start" value attribute.
 - Fixed bug where floating point precision error caused rendering of frame multiple
   times, when computer has been on long time (like a week)
 - Added fake reflection 2d map to cook torrance surface shader.
 - Added optional "additive_blend" parameter for sufrace shaders. Enabled in
   self_illuminate_texture shader.
 - Optimized mesh topology creation more.

20.7.2009
 - Optimized mesh topology creation. Combined millions of memory allocations of few bytes.
 - Fixed HLSL error reporting for vertex shaders.
 - Fixed bug again in shaders where tangent space was wrong when object was translated.
   Non-uniform scaling will break tangent space and is not supported.
 - Dropped light range from attenuation for more physically correct lighting.
   Attenuation is now controlled with light color * intensity (multiplier) with some constant
   value (range 100).

18.7.2009
 - Refactored few shaders.
 - Fixed bug in blinn shader where tangent space was wrong, ie incorrect shading.
 - Implemented Cook-Torrance shader.

17.7.2009
 - Refactored surface (material) parameter building
   - Added class pt::d3d9::rendering::source::material_description
 - Refactored surface (material) parameter linking to surface shader parameters
   - Added class pt::d3d9::rendering::surface_shader_parameters
   - All material parameters can be linked to shared parameters (curves)
 - Added random curve key generation.
   - Seed for deterministic randomisation. (same results each run)
   - Random or uniform time steps
   - Uniform or non-uniform elements for random vectors (colors, texcoords, etc)
   - Can be mixed with hand written keys.
 - Dropped support for p3d materials for now. (texture names read from .3ds)
 - Shader XML files can now include any number of HLSL shader files with
   "include_hlsl" child XML element.
 - Shader compilation error now shows correct file (.cpp, .xml or .hlsl) and
   line number with detailed error.
 - Disabled QueryPerformanceCounter(), using GetTickCount().
 - Fixed free view, while player paused too.

16.7.2009
 - Added class pt::d3d9::rendering::source::material_description
 - Added class pt::d3d9::rendering::surface_shader_parameters
