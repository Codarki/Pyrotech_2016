1. Create new text document in notepad++. Save. CRLF
2. TortoiseGit Add the file. CRLF
3. Commiting... stayed CRLF. Commiting and pushing again.

4. math_utils.h CRLF
5. Edit it in VS. CRLF
6. Commit math_utils.h with VS. CRLF
7. Push with VS. CRLF

8. matrix.h CRLF. Edit one line in VS. CRLF
9. commit. CRLF
10. Git History shows every line changed. (local commit) Git Log shows 130 lines added, 128 removed. Diff shows only 2. TortoiseGitUDiff shows all lines changed.
11. Revert the commit. Revert dialog shows 1 line to be changed. After revert, 130 changed. Still CRLF

At one point, before these steps, notepad++ informed me file had changed and to reload it. It had LF endings. Then I did something and it went back to CRLF. Can't reproduce.

1. Phara made edit to the file. Fetch and Pull from VS, CRLF changed to LF endings locally!!!!
All the rest of the code base remains CRLF.
2. Edit same file with notepad++. LF locally.
Diff and compare shows all lines changed, when about to to commit.
3. Change from notepad++, Edit -> EOL Conversion -> Windows format. CRLF endings locally. Diff and compare shows one line changed, when about to to commit.
